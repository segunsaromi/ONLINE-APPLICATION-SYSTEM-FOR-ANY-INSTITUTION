# ONLINE-APPLICATION-SYSTEM-FOR-ANY-INSTITUTION
This application allows prospective students and candidates to apply to the available course of study in the institution. It offers friendly dashboard that keeps the applicants informed about their application status and how far they have gone.

Firstly i will suggest you upload the sql file. Remove .sql extension and the remaining is the database name you can use to create the database after which you should upload the sql file in there. The database has some test data but you can creat yours while using the application.

I used root and no password. So for the purpose of this application testing you can create a database with root and no password.

This application is simple to use. A prospective students would apply. Aftter application they are required to take note of their application number and phoe number used.

After application i did it in such a way that school fees is automatically added to such application since we cant be doing payment right now on the test application. So they are required to sign-up and create a password which they will use to sign-in in order to complete their registration and submit their form.

When they login they will see the status of their application form filling and are required to complete the information required (e.g. passport photograph, SSCE result and other information.)

Without them completeng these information the application will not allow them submit their form online and for every information they successful complete they will see the notification update on their dashboard.

This application has lots more features and there are lots more feature i want to add to it but at the moment i am busy with other development and would visit it soon.

Please note: I have been playing around this code for a while and hope to put perfection on it like creating a connect file rather than referencing it on every page and using more functions to minmize coding.
